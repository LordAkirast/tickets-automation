# OTRS tickets-automation
This is an automation script developed to interact with the OTRS (Open-source Ticket Request System) platform. It enables the automated execution of specific tasks, such as accessing the OTRS website, retrieving the number of open tickets in the triage queue, and obtaining the ticket count for specific consultants.

With this script, it is possible to simplify and expedite the retrieval of relevant ticket information and automate the monitoring of their status. This can be particularly useful for technical support teams and customer service teams that use OTRS as their ticket management platform.

The code utilizes the Selenium WebDriver library to interact with the Chrome browser and perform necessary actions on the OTRS platform. It also requires the installation of the appropriate ChromeDriver, which is the specific driver for the Chrome browser.

The goal of this script is to facilitate the monitoring and management of tickets in OTRS by providing an automated way to obtain up-to-date information about open tickets and their distribution among consultants.

To run the script, it is necessary to have Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies. Additionally, you need to download the appropriate ChromeDriver and place it in the same directory as the script.
